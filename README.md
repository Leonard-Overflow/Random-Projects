# Random-Projects
his repository is a storage of random project what I build

I create this in my boring class of dart. I'm actually stay in the high school called Etec in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, but i study in a technical school so I have a special classes like this where I(Teorically) learn dart and future flutter. I'm doing this beacuse the laboratoy what I stay now don't have internet and i'm boring.
My english is not very good but I know de basics

I will create a Russian Roulette in python now. Goodbye!
